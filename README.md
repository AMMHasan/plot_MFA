R script for the visualisation of replication profile upon Marker Frequency Analysis on the depth of coverage, calculated from NGS data, to accompany "Genomic Analysis of DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Escherichia coli" (January 2018. Methods in Enzymology; DOI:10.1016/bs.mie.2018.09.001). This R script is the next step to ([MFA](https://github.com/AMMHasan/MFA)) project as an integrated workflow for comparing replication profiles of different *Escherichia coli* strains.

This R script comes as a part of an umbrella project - Establishing a better genomic DNA extraction method for MFA in the [Leach lab](http://leach.bio.ed.ac.uk/index.html), Institute of Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh.
